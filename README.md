- Root is an open-source indoor simulated robot.
- It is built with the intention to test different algorithms related to:
	- Motion planning
	- Dynamics and Control
	- Perception
	- State estimation
- It contains a varity of commonly used sensor that can be easily enabled and disabled as per the requirement.
- With root, there comes root_home and its friends as workspace for it to operate in:
 	1. root_home

	2. root_home_realistic

## Ground truth
- When comparing different state estimation algorithms (eg, sensor fusion of different odometry source, localization with a known map, simultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM) etc) ground truth information becomes very helpful.

- So for this purpos:
	1. ground truth layout has been made from the cad file of root_home

	2. gt_pub node has beed made which publishes different ground truth information.
		- <img src="./root_gazebo/doc/images/gt_pub frames.png" width="500" height="500"/>
		- Example:
